Learning   outcomes   identify      what the learner will know and be able to do by the   end of   a   course – the   essential   and   enduring knowledge, abilities (skills), and attitudes (values,   dispositions) that   constitute   the   integrated   learning needed for successful completion of   this course. The   learning   outcomes   for this   course   summarize what students can expect to learn, and   how   this   course   is   tied   directly   to   the   educational   outcomes   ofthe   degree.<br>Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs)<br>PLOs<br>1.

Elementary   logic   defines   logic   as   the   examining   of   reasoning   and   the   scientific   method   of   judging   the   truth   or   falsity   of statements. A proposition is a statement that is either   true   or   false.   For   this   in-class   activity,   students, in groups, will:<br>●       Examine reasoning in everyday language.    What   elements   of   language   constitute:<br>o          Implication?<br>o          Evidence?<br>o          Proof?<br>o          Counterexamples?<br>o          Induction?<br>o          Deduction?<br>●       Discuss the connections and/or distinctions   in reasoning   logically between   everyday   language and elementary   logic.<br>●       Discuss how reasoning logic is   connected to   computation:<br>o          Boolean Logic<br>o          Decision   Trees<br>o          Expert   Systems<br>o            Graphs<br>o            When   can   all   examples   of   something   be   presented   as   proof   of   a   certain   ‘theory’   computationally?<br>●       See whether you can convince   yourself,   or   a   friend,   that   the   conditional   truth   table   is   correct   by   making   up   English   sentences   in   the   form   “IfA   then   B.”<br>●       Create 2-3 specific problems whereby logic   is   used   in   computation.<br>o          For example, you could use a simple   “If”   statement if   you   were   searching   for   an item in a list or if   you are   determining whether   or not   a   symbol   or   a number   meets   a certain   criteria.<br>Week   1 Discussion: Reasoning and Computation - CLO   1, 3,   5      (Rubric)<br>For this discussion you will examine the ideas regarding reasoning and proofs.
